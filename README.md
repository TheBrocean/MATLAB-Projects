MATLAB-Projects
===============

A collection of MATLAB projects focused on analyzing, testing, and experimenting with popular numerical methods.

Projects
========
Each of these projects required working with and analyzing huge datasets. If any one of these files are run, keep in mind that it may take some time for the program to finish executing. 

Conjugate Gradient Analysis
---------------------------
This project runs experiments on large sets of randomly generated data to measure performance of the Conjugate Gradient Method.

Curvature Flow Analysis
-----------------------
Solve and analyze a P.D.E modeling curvature flow using Euler's Method.

Stiff ODEs Analysis
-------------------
Solve and plot the solution to a series of very stiff ODEs. This project emphasizes the use of Forward and Backward Euler Method
in addition to MATLAB's built in functions.
